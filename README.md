# Spring Cloud Gateway - Resilience & Security (GOTO Aarhus 2021)

Do you want to use a microservices architecture? Are you looking for a solution to manage access to single services
from clients? How can you ensure resilience and security for your entire system? Spring Cloud Gateway is a project
based on Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot which provides an effective way to route traffic to your APIs
and address cross-cutting concerns.

In this session, I'll show you how to configure an API gateway to route traffic to your microservices architecture
and implement solutions to improve the resilience of your system with patterns like circuit breakers, retries,
fallbacks, and rate limiters using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Resilience4J. Since the gateway is the
entry point of your system, itâ€™s also an excellent candidate to implement security concerns like user authentication.
I'll show you how to do that with Spring Security, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, relying on Spring Redis Reactive
to manage sessions.
